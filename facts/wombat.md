# Wombat

- If a predator tries to invade a Wombats burrow, the Wombat will
  block the entryway with its butt. It will then try to crush any
  invader who dares trying to slip past it.

- The reason why they can do this is that their skin is very thick

- Wombats are between 0.9m and 1.3m in length

- They can weigh up to 40kg
