# Anteater

- The anteater's stomach, similar to a bird's gizzard, has hardened folds and
  uses strong contractions to grind the insects, a digestive process assisted
    by small amounts of ingested sand and dirt.
- The anteaters are more closely related to the sloths than they are to any
    other group of mammals.
