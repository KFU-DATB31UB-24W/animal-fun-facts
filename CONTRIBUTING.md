# Contributing to Animal Fun Facts

This is an exercise repository for practicing the contribution workflow
on GitHub; from creating issues to forking to sending a pull request.

Here is how you can help contributing to the project:

- Pull requests to fix inaccurate facts, typos or other
  minor improvements are always welcome.
- If you would like to add a new animal, please open a
  new issue first. Include an initial fact for
  consideration.
- For adding new facts for already existing animals,
  just send a pull request!

Outside of submitting changes, help by discussing issues
and reviewing pull requests is very much welcome too.

Please make sure that

- newly added facts are actually fun and/or interesting,
- the line length in Markdown files should not exceed 80
  characters.
